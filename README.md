# Summary

With this application is it possible to create backups for specific  ```files``` or  ```directories```.
It's possible to store up to a ```100``` slots.

This application doesn't provide a restore option, so you have to do it ```manually```.
The reason for that is because automatically restoring will give certain risk and unpredictability (risk of permanent removing necessary files).
So the restore button will only open your file explorer with the path to the slots and your path to backup.

# Disclaimer

This is a hobby project so the application ```doesn't update automatically``` and the provided installation file doesn't have a signature.
